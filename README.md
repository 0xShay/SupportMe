# SupportMe
## A Flask-based support ticket system powered by SQLite

This project was my NEA submission for the AQA CS (7517) NEA exam, in which I achieved an A* (Computer Science).

## Brief
My sister works at a dance studio and often has to deal with many enquiries and issues. Usually, people raise their issues via a telephone call or by email.

## Solution
The development of a web-based support ticket system would provide a central service which users can use to submit issues, and will also allow for assistants to quickly see unclaimed or unanswered tickets and respond to them promptly.

## Running locally
To run the server locally, first install the `pip` dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file. You can do this using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Then go to the folder and run `python server.py`.

The web server should be live and running at `localhost:5000`.

## This repository is NOT maintained
As prevously stated, this was my NEA submission, and I do not intend to maintain this project or repository. If you'd like to send in a pull request, feel free, and if I have some spare time I'll take a look, but don't get your hopes up.
