## A Flask-based support ticket system powered by SQLite

My sister works at a dance studio and often has to deal with many enquiries and issues. Usually, people raise their issues via a telephone call or by email.

The development of a web-based support ticket system would provide a central service which users can use to submit issues, and will also allow for assistants to quickly see unclaimed or unanswered tickets and respond to them promptly.
